# cdk-appconfig

## Motivation 
This simple project was inspired from [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67579029/aws-cdk-lambda-appconfig-typescript-example-please/74724158#74724158), where I shared [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74724158). 

When I [read docs on the AppConfig construct library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_appconfig-readme.html), I soon realized that it was ripe for L2 and L3 constructs. Hence this library. 

PRs are always welcome ! 

## To-Do/Work In Progress (PRs welcome!!!)
- [x] A more customizable construct allowing consumers for a deeper configuration.
- [x] Add support for semantic validation.
